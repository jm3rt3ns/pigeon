# Pigeon is intended to be a collection of functions and experiments that may be fun, and occasionally useful.

## List of projects
1. [Snake](https://github.com/jm3rt3ns/pigeon/tree/main/snake) (minigame)
1. [Tally](https://github.com/jm3rt3ns/pigeon/tree/main/tally/tally) (financial productivity web app) - easy tracking of how much is left in your budget categories. If you're at the store and deciding if you have something left in the budget to splurge, Tally lets you know at-a-glance whether you have room in the budget!
1. calculate_current_position will calculate the position of a particle given a particular initial velocity vector and initial position; it assumes gravitational acceleration and no other acceleration acting on the particle (could be used to simulate a thrown object). Possibly useful in the context of building simple physics into a game, such as firing a projectile.
