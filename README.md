# Pigeon is intended to be a collection of functions that may be useful.

## List of functions
1. calculate_current_position will calculate the position of a particle given a particular initial velocity vector and initial position; it assumes gravitational acceleration and no other acceleration acting on the particle (could be used to simulate a thrown object). Possibly useful in the context of building simple physics into a game, such as firing a projectile.
